# entropy-reduced-training

Here we provide the source code used for our training methodologies.

The base training methodology (baseline) is based on [CC6204](https://github.com/dccuchile/CC6204/blob/master/2020/tareas/tarea4/utils.py) course's convolutional networks training utilities. Our methodologies extend the base training methodology to implement the entropy reduced training.
